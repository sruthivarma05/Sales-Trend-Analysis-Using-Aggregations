# Sales-Trend-Analysis-Using-Aggregations
This SQL query analyzes monthly sales trends by calculating total revenue and unique order volume from the orders table. It groups data by month and sorts results chronologically to identify patterns in business performance over time.
This SQL query performs a monthly sales trend analysis to understand how revenue and order volume change over time. It extracts the year and month from the order_date field, converts the date into a standard format, and then aggregates data by month. Using the SUM() function, it calculates the total monthly revenue, while COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) determines the number of unique orders placed in each month. Finally, the results are grouped and sorted chronologically, making it easier to identify sales growth patterns, seasonal demand variations, and overall business performance trends across different months.
